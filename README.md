# Reminder-App

This is a Python-based reminder application built using `PyQt5` for the graphical user interface (GUI), `sqlite3` for the database, and `plyer` for notifications. The app allows users to create, view, and delete reminders. It checks reminders every minute and sends notifications when the set reminder time is reached.
